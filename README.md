# MEAN Stack Todo List

This application implements a single page todo list app using the MEAN stack. The MEAN stack is comprised of:

* **(M)ongoDB** - A non-relational database that stores information in a JSON-like format
* **(E)xpress.js** - A web framework for Node.js that enables routing and more in this case
* **(A)ngular.js** - A web frontend accesses the database through an API and displays information to the user
* **(N)ode.js** - A Javascript runtime that allows the backend to be controlled entirely in Javascript
